# Printer Queue

For queueing up several files to be saved to an external drive.

My 3D printer isn't wireless 🙁.

## Getting Started

1. Create a `queue` folder in this folder
2. Put .gcode files in the `queue` folder
3. Run `run.bat` and the files in `queue` get saved to `backup` and the `E:` drive
